# Wireframing

## ðŸ§© What is Wireframing?

**Wireframing** is the process of creating a simplified visual representation (or blueprint) of a user interface. It outlines the structure, layout, and functionality of a page or screenâ€”without focusing on design elements like colors or images.

Wireframes are typically low-fidelity and serve as a foundation for discussion and iteration during the early stages of a design process.

## ðŸš€ Why is Wireframing Important?

- **Clarifies the User Journey**  
  Wireframes help visualize how users will navigate through a product or system.

- **Aligns Stakeholders Early**  
  They provide a tangible draft that designers, developers, and stakeholders can review and discuss before any code is written.

- **Saves Time and Cost**  
  Making changes in wireframes is faster and cheaper than making changes in fully developed interfaces.

- **Identifies Usability Issues**  
  By mapping out interactions and layouts early, teams can catch and resolve usability challenges before they grow.

## ðŸ“Œ Summary

Wireframing is a crucial step in user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design. It bridges the gap between initial ideas and final visual designs, ensuring that the product is functional, user-centered, and aligned with business goals.
